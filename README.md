# The Genome Sequence Project # Participated in the Analysis of Genome Sequences Using Gene Sequences
### Model Employed 
### K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for Covid Case Analysis
#### Worked on the data of the first patient with COVID-19 to be discovered in China 
### SVM for Genome Sequence Analysis 
#### Applied certain natural language processing techniques in order to carry out genome sequence analysis Worked on the data of cancer patients in order to gain a better understanding of genome sequencing
